# Ra

Overlap-layout-consensus based DNA assembler of long uncorrected reads (short for Rapid Assembler).

## Description

Ra is as a fast and easy to use assembler for raw reads generated by third generation sequencing. It consists of [Minimap](https://github.com/lh3/minimap), [Rala](https://github.com/rvaser/rala) and [Racon](https://github.com/isovic/racon) as depicted on figure bellow.

Ra takes as input a single file containing raw reads in FASTQ format and outputs a set of contigs with high accuracy in FASTA format.
